Changes:
   RDCatch Download Events.  An 'Event Offset' setting has been added to
   Download Events to allow date wildcards used in the URL field to be offset
   by the indicated number of days.

   Hard Time Handling in Logs.  The logic for processing hard start times in
   logs has been changed so that a hard time event will be executed when wall
   clock time matches regardless of it's place relative to other hard timed
   events.

   Now & Next Changes.  A new plugin architecture has been added that makes it
   possible to create "Rivendell Loadable Modules" (RLMs for short) that can
   be used to generate Now & Next PAD data to a wide array of external devices
   and services.  Runtime plugin configuration is accomplished in
   RDAdmin->ManageHosts->RDAirPlay->ConfigureNow&Next.  A set of sample
   plugins is provided for transmitting data via UDP and serial ports as well
   as for interfacing to 'social networking' services such as Twitter and
   FaceBook.  Information on writing new plugins can be found in the 'rlm.h'
   header file.

   Dropbox Changes.  Several new dropbox features have been added, including
   the ability to configure a box not to delete source files after import
   (particularly useful in conjunction with satellite-based audio delivery
   services such as AMB-OS and PRSS ContentDepot).  Also new is the ability to
   apply an automatic date offset to any encoded Start or End Date value of
   imported files.

   Automated System Management.  It is now possible to configure various
   objects to be automatically purged from the system after they expire.  For
   audio cuts, this can be configured on a group-wide basis in
   RDAdmin->ManageGroups, while Logs and ELR data purging can be configured in
   RDAdmin->ManageServices.

   RDLogManager Enhancements.  A 'Remarks' field has been added to the Event
   and Clock dialogs to provide an area for entering free-form text notes.

   GPIO Enhancements.  It is now possible to configure separate and
   independent macro carts to execute upon the rising and falling state of a
   GPIO line.

   Username Length.  The previous limit of a maximum of eight characters in a
   Rivendell username has been increased to 255, thus allowing for better
   integration with external authentication systems such as Active Directory.

   Bugfixes.  Several bugfixes have been implemented --  see the ChangeLog for

   date(1) man page for usage].

   Corrected log machine behavior so that a hard start time event occuring 
   during a previously deferred hard start event will cancel the deferred 
   event.

   Added logging for GPIO state transitions in the ripcd(8) log.

Database Update:

   New Record RMLs.  Two new RMLs, 'Start Record Deck' [RS] and 'Stop Record
   Deck' [RR] have been added, allowing any RDCatch record deck to be
   controlled via RML.  Information on the new RMLs can be found in 'rml.sxw'.

   RDLogEdit Runtime Counters.  Time counters have been added in the Edit Log
   screen in RDLogEdit that show the predicted running time of log events from
   the currently selected event to the next STOP and the end of the log, while
   highlighting multiple events will display the runtime of the selected
   events.

   Metadata Import Enhancements.  Support has been added for importing
   metadata from files generated by the BE AudioVault system (chunk type
   'av10').

   supported plain seconds.

   Audio Auditioning -- It's now possible to audition audio directly
   from the Edit Log dialog in RDLogEdit and the Edit Event dialog in
   RDLogManager.  No attempt is made evaluate rotation logic when
   auditioning -- merely the first valid audio found in the selected 
   cart is played.

   Cart Validity Indication (EXPERIMENTAL) -- The color-coding of
   Carts and Cuts in RDLibrary has been altered so as to show the
   event's 'playability' *at the instant the event is viewed*.  The
   yellow 'conditional' indication has been retired.

   Many Bugfixes -- See the ChangeLog for details.

   log playout.  See the ChangeLog for details.

AudioScience Driver:
   Due to stability issues with the 3.xx ASI driver versions, it is
   recommended that v 2.96 or earlier ASI drivers be used with this
   version of Rivendell.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.97.2 and
   librhpi-0.94.7 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
   PAM Authentication Module.  Allows the Rivendell user/group
   assignment to be dynamically managed by PAM-based login systems.

   Play-While-Recording/Play-While-Importing Capability.  It is now
   possible to update cut audio content even while the selfsame cut is
   playing out in RDAirPlay.  (This capability also requires that
   the libradio and librhpi packages be upgraded to the indicated
   versions in order to function properly).

   BugFixes, especially concerning voicetracking, RDLogManager log
   generation and automated downloads in RDCatch.  See the ChangeLog
   for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.69 -- 20 July 2006

Changes:
   Voicetracking.  A major new feature in this version, voicetracking
   gives operators the ability to insert dynamic, "one-off" audio content to
   individual logs as well as the ability to individually customize each segue
   transition of a log.  Carts for voicetracked content are automatically
   created and deleted "on-the-fly" by the system, with no need for individual
   cart management in the Library.

   RDLogManager Changes.  The sequence for generating logs in RDLogManager has
   been completely overhauled, making it now possible to generate a log and
   apply voice tracks even before Traffic import data are available (so-called 
   "incremental log linking").  Several features have also been added to
   support operation with music-intensive formats, such as the ability to
   schedule embedded voicetracks and spots sets from external music scheduling
   systems (currently only tested with RCS Selector).

   RDDBCheck.  A utility for checking consistency of the Rivendell database.
   For information, do (as root):

       rddbcheck --help

   Many, Many Bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.97.1 and

   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.67 -- 16 March 2006

Changes:
   Audio Metadata Import Enhancements.  Rivendell will now recognize
   and import a wide variety of audio metadata formats, including:

      AES46-2002 (aka "CartChunk")
      ID3v1 and ID3v2 Tags
      TM Century "GoldWave" Extensions
      TM Century "GoldDrive" Format

   RDImport Enhancements.  RDImport has been completely rewritten from
   scratch, with an eye to improved stability and features (including
   'SingleCart' and 'DropBox' modes).  Do 'rdimport --help' at a
   command prompt to get a list of the possibilities.

   RDCatch Enhancements.  It's now possible to configure AutoTrim and
   Normalization of Download Events, as well as Normalization of
   Record Events.

   New Report Type.  An 'ASCAP/BMI Electronic Music Report' report
   format has been added.  This uses the so-called "Paris" format to
   generate EDI records that can be submitted directly to ASCAP/BMI
   for satisfaction of a station's music reporting requirements.  New
   data fields (including Composer, Publisher and Usage Type) have
   also been added to the library to accomodate this functionality.

   Many BugFixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.66 -- 15 February 2006

Changes:
   CD Ripper Enhancements.  Major enhancements have been made to the
   CD ripper functionality in the RDLibrary module, including:

      CD-TEXT Support. The rippers now use CD-TEXT data in
      preference to the FreeDB.  If no CD-TEXT data is found on a
      disk, then the FreeDB is searched as before.

      International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) Support.  If
      found, the rippers will now record the ISRC string from each
      track.  These strings can be viewed and/or edited in the
      'CutInfo/Record' dialog box.

      Automatic Cart/Cut Generation.  In the Full Disk ripper, it's
      now possible to rip an entire CD into the system with just a few
      mouse clicks.  This can be done on a track-by-track basis by
      clicking the 'Add New Cart' button in the Select Cut dialog, or
      for all the tracks at once by clicking the 'Set All New Carts'
      button.

   New Build Targets.  It's now possible to build Rivendell as a 
   Slackware package by doing 'make slack' (requires the Slackware
   packaging tools) or as a SLAX module by doing 'make slax' (requires
   the Linux-live scripts and the Slackware packaging tools).

   RDCatch Enhancements.  The previous hard-coded system-wide limit of
   16 RDCatch decks has been removed, making it possible to configure
   and use an arbitrarily large number of decks.

   Miscellaneous Bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.96.1 and
   librhpi-0.94.5 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio

Changes:
   Version and Help Switches.  Every Rivendell module can now be
   invoked with a '--version' switch to display the current version,
   or a '--help' switch to display a short usage summary.

   Scriptibility Enhancements.  Additional command switches have been
   added to RMLSend to enable it (and hence, other Rivendell modules)
   to be scripted using the full set of Linux CLI utilities (cron(1), 
   cat(1), etc).  Do 'rmlsend --help' for a full list of options.

   Startup Logs in RDAirPlay.  It's now possible to specify the
   initial logs to load upon startup of RDAirPlay on the command line.
   Do 'rdairplay --help' for the options.

   New Switcher Devices.  Support has been added for the Broadcast
   Tools SS 4.2 audio switcher and StarGuide III satellite receiver.
   See the file 'SWITCHERS.txt' for details.

   Bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.94.0 and

   A PATH problem in the init script that was causing RDCatch Upload
   and Download events to fail.

   Problems with RDAirPlay starting a Hard Timed event reliably under
   certain situations.

   See the ChangeLog for a full list.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.94.0 and
   librhpi-0.94.4 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.61 -- 22 November 2005

Changes:
   RDLibrary Useability Tweaks.  When new carts are created in
   RDLibrary, they are now considered to officially exist upon clicking
   the 'OK' button in the Add Cart dialog, in contradistinction to the
   old policy where they didn't 'stick' until 'OK' was clicked in the
   Edit Cart dialog.  The old way tended to be confusing for many
   opertors, as clicking 'Cancel' in the Edit Cart dialog would result
   in any recorded audio being deleted.  Also then creating a new
   cart, RDLibrary will now create a single empty cut within the cart
   by default.

   Various Bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.94.0 and
   librhpi-0.94.4 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.60 -- 15 November 2005

Changes:
   ELR/Report Data Handling.  ELR/Report data is now managed on a
   Service-wide basis, rather than being associated with individual
   logs.  This is reflected in a revamped interface in RDLogManager,
   where 'Generate Reports' and 'Delete Report Data' buttons have been
   merged into a single 'Manager Report Data' button.

   SoundPanel Configuration Permissioning.  A new user right,
   'Configure System Panels', can be used to control which users are
   allowed to configure System (type 'S') Sound Panel buttons in
   RDAirPlay.

   Various Bugfixes.  Including bugs affecting the ability to
   generate a new Rivendell database and account lockouts when used
   with certain version of mySQL.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.94.0 and
   librhpi-0.94.4 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.58 -- 4 November 2005

This release fixes a minor bug in the KDE desktop integration code for
the RPM packaging.  For users who do not install from RPM, there is no
difference between this version and v0.9.57. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.57 -- 3 November 2005

This is primarily a bugfix release of Rivendell.  Some minor user
interface tweaks have also been added:

Changes:
   SuSE Desktop Integration.  When installing from RPM, items for the
   various Rivendell modules will now be added to the Panel Menu in
   the 'Applications' and 'System->Desktop Applet' sections.

   Rivendell Icons.  A set of Rivendell icons at various resolutions
   have been added.  They can be found in the package documentation
   directory on an RPM installation, or in 'icons/' in the sources.

   Report Data Management.  It's now possible to manage report/ELR
   data independently of the log it originated from.  A new user
   attribute, called 'Delete Report Data' configures the right to
   delete Report data in the Edit User dialog.  Report data can be
   deleted either when the parent log is deleted, or by means of a new
   'Delete Report Data' button in RDLogManager.

   Numerous Bugfixes.  Including the dilly that was causing responses
   to Yes|No dialog boxes to be ignored.  See the ChangeLog for details.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.94.0 and
   librhpi-0.94.4 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.55 -- 11 October 2005

This is a maintenance/bugfix release of Rivendell.  The following
issues have been addressed:

   RDLibrary.
     Fixed broken marker editor.

     Fixed loss of 'Day of Week' settings when setting a cut to
     'Evergreen' (Mantis bug #85).


   RDAirPlay.
     Fixed corrupt Hard Time display in Full Log Widget (Mantis bug
     #82).

     Fixed failure of space bar to advance events after clicking Full
     Log widget (Mantis bug #60).

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.94.0 and
   librhpi-0.94.4 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.54 -- 6 October 2005

This is primarily a bugfix release of Rivendell.  Some minor user
interface tweaks have also been added:

Changes:
   RDLibrary Tweaks.  Evergreen cuts in the Edit Cart dialog now show
   with a green background.

   RML Behavior.  It is now possible to STOP a macro cart running a
   'Sleep' [SP] command in RDAirPlay.

   RDCatch Source Monitoring Tweaks.  It is now possible to set the
   default state of the source monitors for record decks in RDAdmin,
   and have the monitor's state be preserved across multiple
   invocations of RDCatch.

   RDLogManagerTweaks.  Unneeded and misleading 'Hour' fields have
   been removed from time entry fields where appropriate.

Library Versions:

   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.53 -- 28 September 2005

Changes:
   RDCatch Enhancements.  It is now possible to configure a single
   record 'window' in RDCatch and configure multiple shorter
   recordings within that window to be started by means of GPI
   closures.

   Asynchronous Macro Carts.  It's now possible to designate a macro
   cart as to be executed 'Asynchronously', meaning that, when
   executed within a log in RDAirPlay, any Sleep ['SP'] RMLs contained 
   within the cart  will not delay subsequent log events, but *will* 
   delay subsequent RML statements within the cart itself.  This can
   be useful for achieving various special effects, such as starting a
   music bed and then playing a seperately carted dry voiceover on top
   of it.  

   RDLibrary Enhancements.  RDLibrary will now give explicit warning
   about various out-of-parameter conditions (like audio carts that
   contain no audio).  It's now also possible to specify the 'Forced
   Length' of a cart (for timescaling purposes) without obscuring the
   actual average length of the cart.

   Many Bugfixes.  Especially with regard to RDCatch, MPEG encoding
   and electronic log reconciliation (ELR) functionality.  See the 
   ChangeLog for details.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.94.0 and
   librhpi-0.94.4 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.51 -- 31 August 2005

This version of Rivendell is mostly a bugfix/cleanup release.  Changes
are noted below.

Changes:
   Rdcatch_copy(1).  This is a new importer filter that can be used to
   copy RDCatch events from one Rivendell Host to another, both within
   a single database and between two different Rivendell databases.

   Importer Packaging Changes.  The utilities in the 'importers/'
   subdirectory (wings_filter(1), sas_filter(1), crc-unity4k.sh(1) 
   and rdcatch_copy(1)) now come packaged in their own seperate RPM, 
   called 'rivendell-importers'.  This is because these utilities are
   typically only used once, during system installation, and then
   removed.

   Usability Tweaks.  Several here and there, mostly to make the
   various user interfaces more consistent with each other.  See the
   ChangeLog for details.

   Various bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.49 -- 90 August 2005

Changes:
   Fixed a stupid bug that broke browsing in the Cart Selector and Cut
   Selector dialog boxes when the group selector was set to 'ALL'.

   RDCatch Enhancements.  It's now possible to schedule overlapping
   Record events with the same deck but with different GPI and 
   destination cut parameters.  RDCatch will record to the correct 
   cut on the basis of which GPI was received.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.93.2 and
   librhpi-94.1 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.48 -- 7 August 2005

Changes:
   Upload Events in RDCatch.  It's now possible to schedule the
   automatic export and upload of audio files in RDCatch.  The
   following upload protocols are supported:
      FILE
      FTP
      SMB

   Database Support Cleanups.  Added directives to rd.conf(5) to make
   it possible for Rivendell to work with RDBMS back-ends other than
   mySQL.  This feature has not been at all well tested as of yet.

   Import Filter for AirForce 'Wings' System.  The filter can be used
   to import the entire audio archive of an AirForce 'Wings' system
   *in situ*, without requiring reencoding of audio and while
   preserving much of the library meta-data from the original system.
   See the 'WINGS_FILTER.txt' file in the documentation directory for
   more information.

   New Swticher Device Support.  Added support for the BroadcastTools
   SS16.4 swticher.

   MPEG Cleanups.  Many bugfixes regarding the use and handling of
   MPEG audio.

   RDLogEdit Fixes.  Fixed all known outstanding issues with
   RDLogEdit.

   Miscellaneous Bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for details.

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.93.2 and
   librhpi-94.1 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.47 -- 29 July 2005

Changes:
   Download Events in RDCatch.  It's now possible to schedule the
   automatic download and import of audio files in RDCatch.  The
   following download protocols are supported:
      FILE
      FTP
      HTTP
      HTTPS
      SMB

   RDAdmin Changes.  A number of features have been added to RDAdmin
   to make configuration and management of Rivendell systems easier,
   especially for larger sites.  These include the ability to create
   new Host and Service entries using an already existing Host or
   Service as a prototype, as well as the ability to remotely inspect the
   audio configuration and capabilities of all systems on the Rivendell
   network from a single instance of RDAdmin.  Users of the ALSA
   driver may also want to consult the 'ALSA.txt' for instructions on
   adding an ALSA control device definition to their '.asoundrc'
   file.  While not strictly necessary, such a control device will
   allow Rivendell to provide more specific audio configurtion
   information.

   Numerous bugfixes, including the infamous ripcd(8) race condition.
   See the ChangeLog for details.

New Dependencies:
   Several new dependencies have been added in this release, for which
   new packages may need to be installed.  They are:

      lukemftp
      samba-client
      wget

Library Versions:
   This version requires that, at a minimum, libradio-0.93.1 and
   librhpi-94.1 be installed.  If installing from RPM, the version of
   the currently installed libraries can be determined by doing:

      rpm -q libradio
      rpm -q librhpi

Database Update:
   As always, be sure to run RDAdmin immediately after
   upgrading to allow any necessary changes to the database schema to
   be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.45 -- 18 July 2005

Changes:
   Full Disk Ripping.  It's now possible (by touching the 'Rip Disk'
   button in RDLibrary's main window) to rip all of the tracks on a CD
   to multiple Cart/Cut destinations in a single operation.  The 
   individual track ripper accessed from RDLibrary's Edit Cart dialog 
   remains as well.

   RDLogin User List.  The list of available user names is now shown
   in RDLogin as a pulldown list, rather than requiring the user to
   enter the name.

   Security System.  It's now impossible for the same user to be both
   an Administrator and a regular user, and checking the 'Administer
   System' box in RDAdmin's User Dialog will now gray out all the
   other checkbox choices.  This was done to discourage trolling for
   admin accounts when using RDLogin (see 'RDLogin User List' above).

   Logitek Audio Engine Support.  Full Rivendell integration with
   Logitek's Audio Engine system is now possible through use of Logitek's
   'vGuest' control API (part of their 'Supervisor' application).  I
   would like especially to thank John Davis from Logitek for his 
   invaluable assistance in getting this working.

   Bugfixes.  In particular, bugs affecting audio playout from
   RDLibrary's Edit Audio window, as well as problems with saving long
   logs.  See the ChangeLog for details.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.38 -- 1 July 2005

Changes:
   Security System Cleanups.  A lot of time in this release has gone 
   into ensuring that the various user permission attributes are 
   correctly and consistently enforced across all of Rivendell's modules.

   Group Permissioning by User.  It is now possible to define which
   Library Groups will be visible in RDLibrary on a user-by-user
   basis.  This can be used to effectively 'partition' the Library
   into multiple 'sub-libraries'.

   RDAdmin Overhaul.  RDAdmin's UI has been overhauled to make it
   stylebook-compliant (e.g. doubleclicks now work, focus problems
