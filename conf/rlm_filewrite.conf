; To enable this module, add it to the 'Loadable Modules' list in 
; RDAdmin->ManageHosts->RDAirPlay->ConfigureNow&Next.  The 'Argument'
; field should point to the location of this file.

; Section Header

; 'File1' and working up consecutively
[File1]

; must have write permissions for this location.
Filename=/tmp/rlm_filewrite.txt

; of each PAD update.  If set to '1', each update will be appended to the
; existing contents of the file.
