	* rdadmin/add_station.cpp; increased the New Host Name field max size
	from 20 to 64 (matching the database field capacity) (NOTE: RFC 1035

	'utils/rdimport/rdimport.h' to import files and use the
	CartChunk CutID field to populate Rivendell cart title.
	- rdimport; has an option (--title-from-cartchunk-cutid) to populate the
	cart title using the CartChunk CutID field.
	- dropboxes; add a checkbox option to enable the above feature
	- docs and database have been updated
2007-09-11 Dan Mills <dmills@exponent.myzen.co.uk>
