#
# Copy to remote hosts
#
# Customize this section to list the remote hosts you wish to copy the
# dump to.  Yoou will need two lines for each host:  one to copy the data,
# and another to purge old data.
#
# For example, let's say you have a host called 'rivendell.example.com',
# where you want to put the backups into a directory called 
# '/home/salem/rdbackup'.  You would do:
#
#   scp -q $BACKUP_FILE salem@rivendell.example.com:rd_backup/
#   ssh salem@rdkaim "find /home/salem/rd_backup -mtime $SHELF_LIFE -type f -exec rm \{\} \;"
#
#
# Note that the remote machine must be set up to accept automatic logins via
# ssh(1) in order for this to work!
