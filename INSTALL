DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The larger pieces of the Rivendell documentation are written in XML-DocBook5.
Pre-generated docs are included in the source tarball, so special tools will
not normally be required to view or install them. However, if you need to
rebuild them (either because you've modified the DocBook sources or are
installing from the primary GitHub repository), then you will need the
following:

XML-DocBook5 Stylesheets. Available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/. You will also need to create a
$DOCBOOK_STYLESHEETS variable in your environment that points to the top
of the stylesheet tree. More information can be found at
http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/appa.html#s.stylesheetinstall. On
RHEL-ish systems, they are also available in the 'docbook5-style-xsl'
package.

xsltproc. Command line XSLT processor. Available at
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html

Apache FOP. Formatting Objects (FO) processor. Available at
https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/.

INSTALLATION
There are three major steps to getting a Rivendell system up and
running. They are:

1)  Setting up pre-requisite software

2)  Installing the Rivendell package

3)  Initial configuration


1)  Setting Up Prerequisites

The major prerequisite piece of software needed for a functioning
Rivendell system is the mySQL database engine. This needs to
be accessible from the target system (either by running on the local
host, or on a remote system) before Rivendell installation proper
is commenced. In practice, this means that the 'mysqld' daemon is
running and can be connected to using the mysql(1) client. You will
also need a login name/password for an account on the server with
administrative rights.

The process of configuring mySQL on a given host can be intricate and
is generally beyond the scope of this document. Details can be found
in a number of books on the subject, as well as in the very extensive
documentation that accompanies the server itself.

If GPIO support is desired, this is also the time to install and test
the kernel GPIO driver. Full installation instructions as well as the 
list of currently supported GPIO boards are included in the package.


2)  Installing the Rivendell Package

Once the prerequisites are set up, installation is most often a matter of 
cd'ing to the top of the Rivendell source tree and typing
'./configure', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'. Those
who obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.

The ./configure script will auto-detect what sound drivers (HPI, JACK
or ALSA) are available and enable build support accordingly. To override
this behavior, it's possible to specify '--disable-hpi',
'--disable-jack' or '--disable-alsa' as an argument to './configure'.
Be sure to see the important additional information regarding
configuration in the 'docs/JACK.txt' or 'docs/ALSA.txt' files if you
plan on using those sound driver architectures.

The installation of Rivendell's web services components are controlled
by two parameters passed to 'configure', as follows:

--libexecdir	 Location to install web scripts and static content

--sysconfdir	 Location to install Apache configuration

The specific values to pass will vary widely depending upon the specific
distro in question. Some known good values (assuming a default Apache
setup):

RHEL 5:	  --libexecdir=/var/httpd/rd-bin --sysconfdir=/etc/httpd/conf.d

RHEL 6/7: --libexecdir=/var/www/rd-bin --sysconfdir=/etc/httpd/conf.d

SuSE:	  --libexecdir=/srv/www/rd-bin --sysconfdir=/etc/apache2/conf.d

After doing 'make install', be sure to restart the Apache web service.


3)  Initial Configuration

Next, you'll need to install a small configuration file at
'/etc/rd.conf'. A sample can be found in 'conf/rd.conf-sample'. Much
of this can be used unchanged, with the exception of the entries in the 
[Identity] section. These should be changed to reflect the user and group 
name of the system accounts that will be running Rivendell.

The directory for the audio sample data next needs to be created, as
so:

	mkdir /var/snd

This directory should owned, readable, writable and searchable by the user 
and group specified in the 'AudioOwner=' and 'AudioGroup=' entires in
'/etc/rd.conf' and readable and searchable by Others (mode 0775).

Next, create an empty database on the MySQL/MariaDb server, as well as a
DB user to access it. This user should have the following privileges:

       Select
       Insert
       Update
       Delete
       Create
       Drop
       References
       Index
       Alter
       Create Temporary Table
       Lock Tables

In the '[mySQL]' section of the '/etc/rd.conf' file, set the 'Database=',
'Loginname=' and 'Password=' parameters to the DB name, user and password
that you created. Then, create an initial Rivendell database by doing:

     rddbmgr --create

If all goes well, this command should return with no output.

Finally, start up the Rivendell service by doing (as root):

      systemctl start rivendell

You should now be able to run the various Rivendell components from the
Applications menu.
