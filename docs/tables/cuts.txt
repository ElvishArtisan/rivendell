                   CUTS Table Layout for Rivendell

The CUTS table holds data concerning each individual audio cut on the
system, as opposed to CART (where individual entries may reference
more than one cut, as in the case of rotators).  Following is the
layout of a record in the CUTS table:

FIELD NAME           TYPE              REMARKS
---------------------------------------------------------------
CUT_NAME             char(12)          * Primary key, Base name of WAV file

SAT                  enum('N','Y')
ORIGIN_NAME          char(64)          Workstation ID where recorded
WEIGHT               int(10) unsigned  Relative airplay frequency, 1 = normal
LAST_PLAY_DATETIME   datetime
UPLOAD_DATETIME      datetime          Copy-split upload timestamp
PLAY_COUNTER         int(10) unsigned
LOCAL_COUNTER        int(10)           Resets when cart structure changes
VALIDITY             int(10)           0 = Invalid, 1 = Conditionally Valid,
                                       2 = Valid
CODING_FORMAT        int(10) unsigned  0 = PCM16, 2 = Layer-2, 3 = Layer-3 
SAMPLE_RATE          int(10) unsigned  In samples/sec
BIT_RATE             int(10) unsigned  In bits/sec,  PCM16 = 0
CHANNELS             int(10) unsigned  1 = mono, 2 = stereo
PLAY_GAIN            int(11) signed    In 1/100 dB
START_POINT          int(10) unsigned  Offset to Start point in ms
FADEUP_POINT         int(10) unsigned  Offset to FadeUp point in ms
FADEDOWN_POINT       int(10) unsigned  Offset to FadeDown point in ms
END_POINT            int(10) unsigned  Offset to End point in ms
HOOK_START_POINT     int(10) unsigned  Offset to Hook Start point in ms
HOOK_END_POINT       int(10) unsigned  Offset to Hook End point in ms
TALK_START_POINT     int(10) unsigned  Offset to Talk Start point in ms
TALK_END_POINT       int(10) unsigned  Offset to Talk End point in ms


* Names of WAV files are calculated as follows:

    CCCCCC_NNN.wav

  where:
    CCCCCC = The cart number (000000 - 999999)
       NNN = The rotator offset (000 - 999)

  Thus, we can accomodate up to 1000 cuts in a single rotator.  The
  base name is that part of the name prior to '.wav'.
