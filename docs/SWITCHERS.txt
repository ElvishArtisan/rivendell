----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiveWire LWRP Audio

Driver Name: LiveWire LWRP Audio

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
LiveWire is a distributed audio router and control system, with the 
components (called 'nodes') configured and controled via TCP/IP.  More
information can be found at http://www.axiaaudio.com/.

This driver can be used to create and remove connections between audio
sources and destinations via LiveWire Routing Protocol (LWRP).

Configuration is a matter of entering the IP address, password and base
output number for each node in 
RDAdmin->ManageHosts->Switcher/GPIO->LiveWire Nodes.  The driver
will autodetect all other parameters from the nodes themselves.  The
resulting constellation of nodes can be controled with the 'Switch Take'
['ST'] RML by specifying the LiveWire source stream number as the <input>
parameter and the the base output number+the slot number-1 for the <output>
parameter.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiveWire LWRP GPIO

Driver Name: LiveWire LWRP GPIO

Supported RML Commands:
  GPI Enable ('GE')
  GPI Set ('GI')
  GPO Set ('GO')

GENERAL NOTES:
LiveWire is a distributed audio router and control system, with the 
components (called 'nodes') configured and controled via TCP/IP.  More
information can be found at http://www.axiaaudio.com/.

This driver can be used to control LiveWire's GPIO subsystem by means of
the LiveWire Routing Protocol (LWRP) with both physical as well as 'virtual'
GPIO devices.

Only two items need to be specified in the configuration: the IP address
of the device to control and the 'Layer', with 'V' specifying a virtual
GPIO device and 'D' specifying an actual physical one.  The driver
will autodetect all other parameters (e.g. the number of input and output
lines) from the device itself.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiveWire Multicast GPIO

Driver Name: LiveWire Multicast GPIO

Supported RML Commands:
  GPI Enable ('GE')
  GPI Set ('GI')
  GPO Set ('GO')

GENERAL NOTES:
LiveWire is a distributed audio router and control system, with the 
components (called 'nodes') configured and controled via TCP/IP.  More
information can be found at http://www.axiaaudio.com/.

This driver provides the ability to access GPIO functions from LiveWire-
enabled control surfaces for setups that lack a virtual GPIO device --e.g.
when interfacing audio directly to a LiveWire node without using a native
LiveWire software audio driver or audio adapter.

When configuring it, the 'IP Address' field should contain the address
of the local interface to which the LiveWire network is attached, while
the 'LiveWire GPIOs' list should be populated with the stream number - GPIO
line associations to be used.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Driver Name: Local Audio Adapter

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')
  Switch Add ('SA')
  Switch Remove ('SR')
  Switch Add with Gain ('SX')

GENERAL NOTES:
It's possible to use one or more of the actual audio adapters as a
switcher device using this driver.  Doing so makes it possible to
route audio directly from the adapter inputs to outputs, while at the
same time using it for audio capture/playout in the usual manner.


Driver Name: Logitek vGuest

Supported RML Commands:
  GPI Enable ('GE')
  GPI Set ('GI')
  GPO Set ('GO')
  Set Display ('SD')
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
Before using the driver, the resources within the Logitek Audio Engine
system that you wish to control must be made available in a 'vGuest'
account within the Logitek 'Supervisor' system.  Then, those same
resources must be mapped within the Rivendell driver.  For the 'ST'
RML, the Logitek Engine Numbers and Device Numbers are mapped to 
logical Rivendell 'Inputs' and 'Outputs' within the 'Configure Inputs' 
and 'Configure Outputs' dialogs.  For the GPO RMLs, various Logitek
'switches' (by which we mean anything that can be turned on and off,
such as faders feeds, not just GPIO) are mapped to logical Rivendell
GPIO lines by means of their Logitek Engine, Device and Buss numbers.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quartz Electronics Type 1 Routing Protocol

Driver Name: Quartz Type 1

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')

the provider network.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEGENER UNITY4000 DVB SATELLITE RECEIVER

Driver Name: Wegener Unity 4000

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to one of the two
RS-232 ports on the unit.  If possible, use serial port number one,
as the reciever uses a larger data buffer with that port.  The
selected port should be configured in the reciever to be of type
"Terminal" with a speed of 19200.  Serial port parameters should be
set to 19200 baud rate, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
and no terminator.  Once configured, use RDAdmin to create inputs that
correspond to the DVB stream names available on the selected DVB
carrier.

Caution is needed when scheduling record events from the Unity4000, as
the unit is capable of outputting a given DVB stream to only a single 
output at a time.  Commanding a stream to an output will cause that 
stream to be silently deselected from a previously selected output.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
