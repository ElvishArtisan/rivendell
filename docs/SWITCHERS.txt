----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiveWire LWRP Audio

Driver Name: LiveWire LWRP Audio

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
LiveWire is a distributed audio router and control system, with the 
components (called 'nodes') configured and controled via TCP/IP.  More
information can be found at http://www.axiaaudio.com/.

This driver can be used to create and remove connections between audio
sources and destinations via LiveWire Routing Protocol (LWRP).

Configuration is a matter of entering the IP address, password and base
output number for each node in 
RDAdmin->ManageHosts->Switcher/GPIO->LiveWire Nodes.  The driver
will autodetect all other parameters from the nodes themselves.  The
resulting constellation of nodes can be controled with the 'Switch Take'
['ST'] RML by specifying the LiveWire source stream number as the <input>
parameter and the the base output number+the slot number-1 for the <output>
parameter.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiveWire LWRP GPIO

Driver Name: LiveWire LWRP GPIO

Supported RML Commands:
  GPI Enable ('GE')
  GPI Set ('GI')
  GPO Set ('GO')

GENERAL NOTES:
LiveWire is a distributed audio router and control system, with the 
components (called 'nodes') configured and controled via TCP/IP.  More
information can be found at http://www.axiaaudio.com/.

This driver can be used to control LiveWire's GPIO subsystem by means of
the LiveWire Routing Protocol (LWRP) with both physical as well as 'virtual'
GPIO devices.

Only two items need to be specified in the configuration: the IP address
of the device to control and the 'Layer', with 'V' specifying a virtual
GPIO device and 'D' specifying an actual physical one.  The driver
will autodetect all other parameters (e.g. the number of input and output
lines) from the device itself.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiveWire Multicast GPIO

Driver Name: LiveWire Multicast GPIO

Supported RML Commands:
  GPI Enable ('GE')
  GPI Set ('GI')
  GPO Set ('GO')

GENERAL NOTES:
LiveWire is a distributed audio router and control system, with the 
components (called 'nodes') configured and controled via TCP/IP.  More
information can be found at http://www.axiaaudio.com/.

This driver provides the ability to access GPIO functions from LiveWire-
enabled control surfaces for setups that lack a virtual GPIO device --e.g.
when interfacing audio directly to a LiveWire node without using a native
LiveWire software audio driver or audio adapter.

When configuring it, the 'IP Address' field should contain the address
of the local interface to which the LiveWire network is attached, while
the 'LiveWire GPIOs' list should be populated with the stream number - GPIO
line associations to be used.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Driver Name: Local Audio Adapter

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')
  Switch Add ('SA')
  Switch Remove ('SR')
  Switch Add with Gain ('SX')

GENERAL NOTES:
It's possible to use one or more of the actual audio adapters as a
switcher device using this driver.  Doing so makes it possible to
route audio directly from the adapter inputs to outputs, while at the
same time using it for audio capture/playout in the usual manner.


Driver Name: Logitek vGuest

Supported RML Commands:
  GPI Enable ('GE')
  GPI Set ('GI')
  GPO Set ('GO')
  Set Display ('SD')
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
Before using the driver, the resources within the Logitek Audio Engine
system that you wish to control must be made available in a 'vGuest'
account within the Logitek 'Supervisor' system.  Then, those same
resources must be mapped within the Rivendell driver.  For the 'ST'
RML, the Logitek Engine Numbers and Device Numbers are mapped to 
logical Rivendell 'Inputs' and 'Outputs' within the 'Configure Inputs' 
and 'Configure Outputs' dialogs.  For the GPO RMLs, various Logitek
'switches' (by which we mean anything that can be turned on and off,
such as faders feeds, not just GPIO) are mapped to logical Rivendell
GPIO lines by means of their Logitek Engine, Device and Buss numbers.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quartz Electronics Type 1 Routing Protocol

Driver Name: Quartz Type 1

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')
  Fire Salvo ('FS')

GENERAL NOTES:

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to the 'Computer
RS-232' port on the AXC-8 System Controller.  Serial port parameters
should be set to 9600 baud rate, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
and no terminator.  The AXC-8 must be equipped with firmware built to
use the 'conventional' command protocol -- the 'enhanced' version will
not work!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIERRA AUTOMATED SYSTEMS 64000 AUDIO ROUTER

Rivendell contains two drivers that support this switcher, depending
upon how the physical connection is made.  If possible, use the 'SAS
64000-GPI' driver, as it is better tested and provides superior
performance.

Driver Name: SAS 64000

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to the 'Computer
RS-232' port on the AXC-8 System Controller.  Serial port parameters
should be set to 9600 baud rate, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
and no terminator.  The AXC-8 must be equipped with firmware built to
use the 'conventional' command protocol -- the 'enhanced' version will
not work!

Driver Name: SAS 64000-GPI

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')
  GPO Set ('GO')

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to the 'Computer
RS-232' port on a GPI-1600 GPIO interface.  Serial port parameters
should be set to 19200 baud rate, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
and no terminator.  This driver allows control of the system's GPO
outputs as well as audio crosspoints.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIERRA AUTOMATED SYSTEMS Universal Serial Interface (USI)

Driver Name: SAS User Serial Interface

Supported RML Commands:

  GPO Set ('GO')
  Fire Salvo ('FS')
  Console Label ('CL')

GENERAL NOTES:
Control can done either by means of an RS-232C connection to one of
the serial ports on a DRC-16E card or by means of TCP/IP to a PC
running SAS's Server Module software.  TCP connections are normally made
to port 1350 on the Server Module system.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SINE SYSTEMS ACU-1 (PROPHET VERSION)

Driver Name: Since ACU-1 (Prophet)

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Add ('SA')
  Switch Remove ('SR')
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to the  RS-232 port on
the unit.  Serial port parameters in RDAdmin should be set to 57600 baud
rate, even parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no terminator.

The ACU-1 should be set to use factory default settings.  This can be done
by simultaneously pressing buttons 1 and 8 on the front panel of the unit
for at least one second.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STARGUIDE III Satellite Receiver

Driver Name: StarGuide III

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to the
RS-232 port on the unit.  The port should be configured on the
receiver to use a speed of 9600.  Serial port parameters in RDAdmin
should be set to 9600 baud rate, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
and no terminator.  Once configured, use RDAdmin to create inputs that
correspond to the StarGuide Provider and Source IDs available on the 
selected DVB carrier.  Provider and Source ID data is available from
the provider network.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEGENER UNITY4000 DVB SATELLITE RECEIVER

Driver Name: Wegener Unity 4000

Supported RML Commands:
  Switch Take ('ST')

GENERAL NOTES:
Control is done by means of an RS-232C connection to one of the two
RS-232 ports on the unit.  If possible, use serial port number one,
as the reciever uses a larger data buffer with that port.  The
selected port should be configured in the reciever to be of type
"Terminal" with a speed of 19200.  Serial port parameters should be
set to 19200 baud rate, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit
and no terminator.  Once configured, use RDAdmin to create inputs that
correspond to the DVB stream names available on the selected DVB
carrier.

Caution is needed when scheduling record events from the Unity4000, as
the unit is capable of outputting a given DVB stream to only a single 
output at a time.  Commanding a stream to an output will cause that 
stream to be silently deselected from a previously selected output.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
