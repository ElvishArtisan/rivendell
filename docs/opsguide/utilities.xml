  <title>Interfacing with the Linux Ecosystem: Command-Line Utilities</title>
  <para>
    Rivendell includes a number of command-line utilities. Some of these
    can be used to perform efficient &quot;bulk&quot; operations --e.g.
    import thousands of audio files in one command -- while others are
    useful in various aspects of system maintenance. This section provides
    a brief overview of the available utilities; full documentation for each
    is available via the Linux man page facility.

  <sect1 xml:id="sect.utilities.rdclilogedit">
    <title>rdclilogedit(1)</title>
    <para>
      <command>rdclilogedit</command><manvolnum>1</manvolnum> is a
      command-line interface (CLI) program that can be used to edit
      Rivendell logs. It is loosely modeled after the venerable
      <command>ed</command><manvolnum>1</manvolnum> command-line editor
      and so is particularly well suited for use in scripting
      environments.
    </para>
