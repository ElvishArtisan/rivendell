Cuts are scheduled for playout at play-time based on the following logic:

1. Least Played
Cuts will be selected based on which one was played the least. This will provide
balanced playout. Weighting is ignored.


2. Randomly
Cuts will be selected based on randomizing their playback. Playout is influenced
by weighting and by how frequently (infrequently) a cut has been played.


3. Expiring First
Cuts that expire first and are played the least will be put first. This ensures that 
those cuts will be prioritized to play before they expire. Weighting is ignored.


4. Sequentially
Cuts in a cart will be played in their order (1, 2, 3, etc..) sequentially. 
This is useful with sports game sponsors.  There is no attention paid to 
play count or weighting.
